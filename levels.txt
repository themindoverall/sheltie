First thing you have to learn to do is use the signs.
There will be simple puzzles where you must use your limited amount of signs to guide the heroes around obstacles.
You're then introduced to sword heroes.  They will cut down your signs when they go past them, and so you'll have to deal with that.
There will be a puzzle or so where you want the sword hero to chop down your sign too.
Next, you are introduced to the treasure chest.  These let you give a sword to any hero you have rather than them starting with it.
Next, you encounter your first set of enemies.  These enemies will shoot your heroes with arrows when they see them.
To combat them, first you just time your stops and goes for your heroes.
Then, you have to sneak up behind one and get him with your sword hero.
Finally, you receive shield heroes that will block enemy arrows aimed at his face.
